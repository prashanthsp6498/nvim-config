# nvim-config

Most of the configuration taken from [KickStart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) repo and modified or restructured as per my need.

## Note
- always use node latest version (ts/js lsp won't work in older node version's)
- Use [patched fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.3.3/JetBrainsMono.zip) to fix random character for language icon place holder

## Lsp Configs
- [Java](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.jdt.ls)
- [Lua](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/releases)
- [Python](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server)
