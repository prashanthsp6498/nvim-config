# nvim-config


### For my reference
- always use node latest version (ts/js lsp won't work in older node version's)
- Use [patched fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.3.3/JetBrainsMono.zip) to fix random character for language icon place holder


### TODO
- Add c# DAP support (Both unity and normal console application)
  - (Fucking visual studio takes 2GB of RAM where as nvim can do the same job in 200MB of RAM(This is in the worst case scenario))
- Need to refactor current config as per work related requirement (So that one config can be used for both the work and personal coding setup instead of multiple configs)
